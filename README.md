# Sales-Dashboard
1. INTRODUCTION
The e-commerce and online retail sector continue to expand rapidly, driven by digital transformation and increased consumer preference for online shopping. With this growth comes a vast amount of transactional data that, when analyzed effectively, can yield powerful insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and operational efficiency.
This project, titled ‚ÄúOnline Store Sales Analysis using Excel Dashboard‚Äù, is built on a real-world dataset simulating sales from an online store. The dataset contains key transactional and customer details such as order ID, product category, payment method, shipping cost, profit, age group, and gender. The objective is to transform this data into a dynamic, interactive Excel dashboard that highlights trends and supports business decision-making.
Using Excel features such as pivot tables, calculated fields, slicers, and charts, the project seeks to answer questions like:
‚Ä¢	Which product categories generate the highest revenue and profit?
‚Ä¢	How do sales differ by age group and gender?
‚Ä¢	What are the most popular payment channels and their associated revenues?
‚Ä¢	Which states or regions show the highest and lowest order volumes?
‚Ä¢	Are there trends based on order status or customer demographics?
The final dashboard provides an intuitive interface for business users, analysts, and management teams to interact with the data and make informed decisions‚Äîwithout needing advanced technical knowledge.
In essence, this project demonstrates how Microsoft Excel can be used as a powerful business intelligence tool to convert raw e-commerce data into actionable insights for marketing, operations, and strategic planning.

3. DATASET PREPROCESSING
Before building the Excel dashboard, the dataset underwent comprehensive cleaning and preprocessing using Microsoft Excel. This ensured all records were consistent, accurate, and ready for advanced visualization and reporting.
‚úÖ Key data preparation steps included:
1.	Handling Missing and Incomplete Data
‚Ä¢	The dataset was scanned for missing values in key columns such as Category, Order Status, Payment Method, and Profit.
‚Ä¢	Empty cells were either filled logically (e.g., assigning ‚ÄúUnknown‚Äù to missing gender values) or filtered out if non-essential.
2.	Standardization of Column Names
‚Ä¢	Column headers were formatted for clarity and uniformity, ensuring easy use in pivot tables (e.g., ‚ÄúShipping Cost‚Äù instead of ‚Äúshipping cost‚Äù).
3.	Removal of Duplicates and Anomalies
‚Ä¢	Duplicate order entries were identified and removed to maintain aggregation accuracy.
‚Ä¢	Outliers such as negative profits or unrealistically high shipping costs were flagged and reviewed.
4.	Data Type Corrections
‚Ä¢	Columns such as Sales, Profit, Shipping Cost, and Quantity were formatted as numeric or currency types to support correct calculations.
‚Ä¢	The Date field was converted to Excel's date format to allow monthly trend analysis.
5.	Creation of Calculated Fields
‚Ä¢	New fields such as Month, Year, and Profit Margin were derived for deeper time-based and profitability analysis.
‚Ä¢	Additional calculated fields were included within pivot tables to show average order value, total orders per state, and sales contribution by category.
6.	Sorting and Filtering for Analysis
‚Ä¢	The data was organized by State, Gender, Age Group, and Category to streamline pivot chart development.
‚Ä¢	Filters were applied to remove invalid transactions (e.g., canceled or returned orders during initial modeling).

üßæ Outcome
After cleaning and transforming the dataset, it was fully optimized for Excel-based analytics. Leveraging Excel‚Äôs built-in tools such as pivot tables, charts, slicers, timelines, and conditional formatting, the final interactive dashboard enables users to:
‚Ä¢	Filter and compare product categories
‚Ä¢	Visualize profit distribution by demographics
‚Ä¢	Track sales trends by region or payment method
‚Ä¢	Explore high-level KPIs for strategic decisions
This project showcases how Excel can turn raw online sales data into a visually engaging, informative dashboard for decision-makers across marketing, operations, and executive leadership.
4. ANALYSIS ON DATASET
The analysis was conducted on an e-commerce sales dataset simulating transactions from multiple platforms (e.g., Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, Meesho, etc.) across Indian states. The dataset included information such as product category, platform, gender, state, and monthly sales figures. The goal was to generate business insights using Microsoft Excel‚Äôs data modeling capabilities, including pivot tables, calculated fields, slicers, and interactive charts.
